This Ansible Collection provides **Configuration as Code** for **Red Hat Satellite** using Ansible.
It allows to **export** an existing Satellite configuration into a file tree and, later, **import** (apply) that configuration back into Satellite in a repeatable and automated way.

The collection is designed to work both with `ansible-playbook` and with `ansible-navigator` (Execucion Environments).

## Features

- Export Satellite configuration to YAML files
- Import Satellite configuration from YAML files
- Uses official `redhat.satellite` Ansible modules

## Requirements

The only one collection required by `infra.satellite_configuration` is the `redhat.satellite`. You can copy this `requirements.yaml` file example:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: infra.satellite_configuration
  - name: redhat.satellite
...
```

### Ansible, Python and other requirements

The following are also requirements:

- Ansible Core >= 2.16
- Python library `PyYAML` (used by the YAML formatter module)
- Red Hat Satellite 6.17
- Access to Satellite API
- One of the following:
  - `ansible-playbook`
  - `ansible-navigator` (recommended)

## Installing this collection

You can install the `infra.satellite_configuration` collection with the Ansible Galaxy CLI (the dependency -redhat.satellite- will be installed automatically when possible):

```console
ansible-galaxy collection install infra.satellite_configuration
```

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it with `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: infra.satellite_configuration
  - name: redhat.satellite
    # If you need a specific version of the collection, you can specify like this:
    # version: ...
...
```

## Using this collection

Examples of how to run the playbooks in the `playbooks` directory can be found in the [`tests/README`](https://github.com/redhat-cop/infra.satellite_configuration/blob/devel/tests/README.md).

### Configuration file layout

Export and import share the same layout under `satellite_configuration_filetree_path` (default `/tmp/satellite_filetree_config`):

```text
satellite_configuration_filetree_path/
├── satellite_organizations.d/
│   └── satellite_organizations.yaml
├── satellite_settings.d/
│   └── satellite_settings.yaml
├── vault_template.yaml
└── …
```

Each object type uses a `satellite_<resource_plural>.d/` directory with one or more YAML fragments. There is no organization or environment path nesting — export output from `filetree_create` can be consumed directly by `filetree_read`.

`filetree_create` also writes `vault_template.yaml` at the tree root. CaC fragments reference its `vault_*` variables for LDAP bind passwords, Internal-user passwords, encrypted settings, host-specific settings, and installation-medium target FQDN. Replace placeholder values, optionally encrypt the file, and pass it on import with `-e@…/vault_template.yaml`.

### Source and target Satellite connections

For round-trip export → import, define separate endpoints so a single vars file never risks writing back into production:

```yaml
satellite_source:
  server_url: "https://sat-01.corp.example.com"
  validate_certs: true
  admin:
    username: admin
    password: "{{ vault_source_admin_password }}"
  template:
    mode: "0666"

satellite_target:
  server_url: "https://sat.rh.corp.example.com"
  validate_certs: true
  admin:
    username: admin
    password: "{{ vault_target_admin_password }}"
```

`filetree_create` reads from `satellite_source`; `filetree_read` and `dispatch` write to `satellite_target`. When only one endpoint is involved, keep using the legacy `satellite` dict.

The import playbook `run_filetree_read.yaml` uses two plays so `satellite_target` is resolved to `satellite` before `module_defaults` references `satellite.*` (ansible-core evaluates play-level `module_defaults` at parse time).

### Environment overrides

For cross-environment promotion (prod → DR, dev → staging), set `satellite_configuration_overrides_path` to a directory with the same `satellite_<type>.d/` layout as the base export. `filetree_read` merges override fragments on top of the base tree by object `name` (override wins on collision). Per-type `merge_key` can be set on entries in `satellite_configuration_filetree_read_tasks`.

```text
/tmp/satellite_filetree_config/          # base export
overrides/                               # satellite_configuration_overrides_path
├── satellite_settings.d/
│   └── satellite_settings.yaml
└── satellite_subnets.d/
    └── satellite_subnets.yaml
```

```yaml
# overrides/satellite_settings.d/satellite_settings.yaml
---
satellite_settings:
  - name: unattended_url
    value: "https://sat-prod.example.com"
  - name: administrator
    value: "admin@prod.example.com"
```

The [`configs/`](configs/) directory in this repository is an example **greenfield** tree: hand-authored desired state using the same `.d/` layout, without exporting from an existing Satellite.

### Subscription manifest

Content operations require a subscription manifest on the target organization. Before repository and product tasks, `dispatch` validates that a manifest is present (`satellite_configuration_dispatch_manifest_validate: true` by default). Upload a manifest with:

```yaml
satellite_configuration_dispatch_manifest_upload: true
satellite_manifest_path: /path/to/manifest.zip
satellite_configuration_dispatch_manifest_organization: "Default Organization"
```

Set `satellite_configuration_dispatch_manifest_validate: false` only when content tags are skipped.

### Supported object types

The three roles (`filetree_create`, `filetree_read`, `dispatch`) cover the object types listed in [`filetree_read` defaults](roles/filetree_read/defaults/main.yml).

The following Satellite objects are **not yet** covered end-to-end (Issue #11); extend the collection using the skills under [`skills/`](skills/README.md) when needed:

- Compute resources and compute profiles
- Global parameters
- SCAP content and policies
- Job templates
- Webhooks
- HTTP proxies
- Remote execution features

### Scale at your needs

The input data can be organized in a very flexible way, letting the user use anything from a single file to an entire file tree to store the satellite objects definitions, which could be used as a logical segregation, as needed in real scenarios.
