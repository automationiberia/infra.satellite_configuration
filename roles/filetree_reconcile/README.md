# infra.satellite_configuration.filetree_reconcile

Reconcile the live Satellite configuration against Configuration as Code (CaC).

## Workflow

1. **Export** — `filetree_create` writes the current API state to `satellite_configuration_filetree_reconcile_live_path`.
2. **Compare** — `filetree_reconcile_diff` pairs YAML files by relative path between the live and CaC `.d/` directories. Each pair is compared at file level (whitespace-normalized text, like `diff`); only when a pair differs semantically are reconcile entries generated. One file pair is processed at a time.
3. **Generate** — diff fragments are written to `satellite_configuration_filetree_reconcile_diff_path` with:
   - `state: absent` when an object exists in the live export but not in CaC
   - `state: present` when an object exists in CaC but not in the live export, or when definitions differ (CaC wins)
   - For `state: present`, fields that exist on the live object but are omitted from CaC are emitted with an empty value (`""`, `{}`, or `[]`) so manual API drift is cleared on dispatch
4. **Apply** — `filetree_read` loads only object types that have fragments under `.reconcile_diff/` (not the full CaC tree), then `dispatch` applies them to `satellite_target`.

## Requirements

- `satellite_source` for export (step 1)
- `satellite_target` for apply (step 4)
- CaC fragments under `satellite_configuration_filetree_reconcile_cac_path`

## Role Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `satellite_configuration_filetree_reconcile_cac_path` | `satellite_configuration_filetree_path` | Optional override when CaC lives outside the filetree path |
| `satellite_configuration_filetree_reconcile_live_path` | `{{ satellite_configuration_filetree_path }}/.reconcile_live` | Live export output |
| `satellite_configuration_filetree_reconcile_diff_path` | `{{ satellite_configuration_filetree_path }}/.reconcile_diff` | Generated diff fragments |
| `satellite_configuration_filetree_reconcile_export` | `true` | Run export step |
| `satellite_configuration_filetree_reconcile_compare` | `true` | Run compare/generate step |
| `satellite_configuration_filetree_reconcile_apply` | `true` | Run apply step |
| `satellite_configuration_filetree_reconcile_tasks` | `{{ satellite_configuration_filetree_read_tasks }}` | Object types to compare |
| `satellite_configuration_filetree_reconcile_secure_logging` | `true` | Scope `no_log` on sensitive compare tasks |

## Example Playbook

## Tags

| Tag | Phase |
| --- | --- |
| `export` | Live export (`filetree_create` → `.reconcile_live/`) |
| `compare` | Reset diff directory and compare/generate (directory setup tasks) |
| `apply` | Load diff fragments (`filetree_read`) and apply (`dispatch`) |
| `<object_type>` | Per-type compare only (for example `organizations`, `domains`) — forwarded from `satellite_configuration_filetree_read_tasks` |

Per-type tags filter **compare** and **apply** (object types only; workflow tags `export`, `compare`, and `apply` are excluded from object-type filtering). When object-type tags are present on the CLI, only those types are compared or applied. When only workflow tags are used (for example `compare` or `apply`), all object types run for that phase.

Examples:

```bash
# Full reconcile (export + compare + apply)
ansible-playbook playbooks/run_filetree_reconcile.yaml -e@vars/satellite.yaml

# Re-compare all types using an existing live export (no re-export, no apply)
ansible-playbook playbooks/run_filetree_reconcile.yaml -e@vars/satellite.yaml \
  --tags compare \
  -e '{satellite_configuration_filetree_reconcile_export: false, satellite_configuration_filetree_reconcile_apply: false}'

# Re-compare one type only (no full diff directory reset)
ansible-playbook playbooks/run_filetree_reconcile.yaml -e@vars/satellite.yaml \
  --tags provisioning_templates \
  -e '{satellite_configuration_filetree_reconcile_export: false, satellite_configuration_filetree_reconcile_apply: false}'

# Compare and apply organizations only (no live re-export)
ansible-playbook playbooks/run_filetree_reconcile.yaml -e@vars/satellite.yaml \
  --tags organizations,apply \
  -e '{satellite_configuration_filetree_reconcile_export: false}'

# Apply an existing diff without re-export or re-compare
ansible-playbook playbooks/run_filetree_reconcile.yaml -e@vars/satellite.yaml \
  --tags apply \
  -e '{satellite_configuration_filetree_reconcile_export: false, satellite_configuration_filetree_reconcile_compare: false}'
```

Generate diff only (no apply): set `satellite_configuration_filetree_reconcile_apply: false` or omit the `apply` tag.
